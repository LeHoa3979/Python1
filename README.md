# VNM Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the **VNM stock price for the next day** based on historical data. The model is validated using **17 years of historical data** to ensure reliability and accuracy in predictions.

## Features
- **Historical data simulation for VNM stock**
- **Data cleaning and visualization**
- **Machine learning model training for price prediction**
- **Error evaluation and backtesting over 17 years**
- **Model improvement with additional predictive features**

## Project Workflow
1. **Download VNM historical stock data**
2. **Data Cleaning & Visualization**: Remove inconsistencies and visualize trends
3. **Set Machine Learning Goals & Train Initial Model**
4. **Evaluate Errors & Implement Backtesting**: Measure accuracy over a long period
5. **Enhance Model with Additional Predictive Features**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models)
- **Backtesting framework** (Model validation)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vnm-stock-prediction.git
   cd vnm-stock-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the model:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Results & Evaluation
The project includes **backtesting analysis** to assess the modelâ€™s performance over a 17-year period, ensuring confidence in its predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Integrating **deep learning models** for better accuracy
- Adding **macroeconomic indicators** to enhance predictions
- Implementing **real-time data updates**
